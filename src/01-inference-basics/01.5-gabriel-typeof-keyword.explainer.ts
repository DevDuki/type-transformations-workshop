// Gabriel Vergnaud explains the typeof keyword, and the type/value level

/**
 * Type level: This is kind of the "typescript world". You can see the type world as a whole programming language in itself, that uses
 * typescript syntax to declare/construct types.
 *
 * Value level: This is kind of the "javascript world" where variables, functions and so on exists.
 *
 * In general, the 2 levels exist separately and the only gate to cross these worlds is via the keyword "typeof", which takes a value from
 * the value level and converts it into a type for the type level. This is a very interesting concept to think of typescript.
